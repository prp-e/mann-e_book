# Introduction

This is the book of _Mann-E_, the Iranian startup specializing in _text to image generation_. This book will help you understand how the data is gathered, how it's preprocessed and how the model has been fine-tuned. Also you will learn how you can replicate the procedure and make your very own image generation system.

## What exactly you learn in this book?

- What is a diffusion model and why it matters. 
- What is _fine-tuning_. 
- What exactly is a _prompt_ and what is _prompt engineering_. 
- How we can use other AI tools to generate the input data for our own use. 
- How can we fine-tune stable diffusion for our needs? 
- What is _checkpoint merging_ and why that matters.
- What are the necessary steps to get the best results possible in an image generation model.

## Who should read this book?

This book is just documenting experiences with _Stable Diffusion_ and fine-tuning the [Stable Diffusion 1.5](https://huggingface.co/runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5) model which is very popular at the time of writing this book. 

_NOTE: Stable Diffusion XL 1.0 is also out, but it still isn't a good choice for fine-tuning_.

So everyone who has some level of enthusiasm for AI image generation and fine-tuning models, this book is for you. 

## How to read this book.

This book includes technical details of an AI program, so having a background in computer scinece or AI is necessary. Although I personally tried to keep things as simple as possible, because understanding the platform has a better outcome in users' minds. 

Everywhere a code snippet is shown, there will be a clear explanation of what is happening there. Each prompt and each technical word used here will be explained and there will be no worries if you are not an experienced expert in the field.
